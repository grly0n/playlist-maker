# Playlist Maker
 
*Currently a work in progress, this document outlines the intended functionality*

A simple application that takes a Spotify link as an input and automatically adds relevant song information (title, artist, album) into a list. When the list is exported, the songs are automatically downloaded and the list is saved as a .txt file. For personal use when creating playlists and getting music for my KUCI radio show.
